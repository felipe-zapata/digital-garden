### Jump planification

I'm currently on my jump number 17th

* [x] Hop and pop
  * Stable exit
  * Landing with downwind
    * [x] Pack a main parachute without assistance.
    * [x] Jump and deploy while stable within five seconds after exit from 3,500 feet AGL.
* [x] Check dive
  * [x] Demonstrate freefall control on all axes, with a backloop, front loop, and barrel roll
  * [x] Dive a minimum of 100 feet after another jumper and dock safely without assistance from the other jumper (two times).
  * [x] Locate and open clear of other jumpers and wave off to signal deployment
  * [x] Plan and independently execute a break-off from a group skydive with a minimum 100 feet of horizontal sep- aration from another jumper or group. Separation must be gained independently in a straight track within ten degrees of a radial heading from the center of the formation.
  *   [x] Check dive with USPA Instructor (See SIM 3-2.A.1.c)

      The examining USPA Instructor conducts a skydive with the applicant to verify practical knowledge in the following areas:

      1. choosing the spot and selecting and guiding the pilot to the correct exit and opening point in routine conditions
      2. pre-jump equipment checks for self and others
      3. planning an effective group break-off
      4. right 360, left 360, and a backloop (backloop to be completed within 60 degrees of the original heading)
      5. docking from 20 feet (evaluator flies into position)
      6. breakoff altitude recognition and tracking for a minimum of 100 feet
      7. signal before deployment and overall awareness during and after deployment
      8. planning and flying a logical landing pattern that promotes a smooth traffic flow and avoids other jumpers
      9. packing and preparing equipment for the next jump
* [x] Another jump
  * [x] Perform a braked approach and landing.
  * [x] Above 1,000 feet, perform front riser dives and turns (may be waived if insufficient strength).
* [x] Another
  * [x] Above 2,500 feet, perform a maximum-performance 90-degree toggle turn, followed immediately by a turn of at least 180 degrees in the opposite direction (two times).
