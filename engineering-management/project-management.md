**The summary of how companies manage projects is “it depends”.** And this should not be very surprising. A newly founded startup with five people will see success in different ways from a 1,000-person, slowly growing non-tech company.

### **Methodologies used by companies in this survey were:**

* _No “formal” methodology:_ common for public and venture-funded tech companies.&#x20;
* _Plan, build, ship:_ common for public and venture-funded tech companies.&#x20;
* _Scrum:_ common for large, non-tech companies, non-venture funded companies and consultancies.&#x20;
* _Kanban:_ mentioned across all companies.&#x20;
* _SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework):_ mentioned with large, non tech companies and a non-venture funded company.&#x20;
* _Shape Up:_ mentioned for a few venture-funded companies.

### **Project management approaches that do not work well:**

* Engineers not involved in estimations.
* Requirements changing, even with dedicated project managers.
* Team with no autonomy to change a failing project management approach also recorded low satisfaction.

### How big tech runs projects

* No "central" methodology.
* _Methodology "typically used":_ Plan (6-pager, RFC, Design Doc, ERD) -> Build (iterate) -> Ship, or GSD (Get Shit Done, 6-week cycles).
* Who leads?, Tech lead or an engineer. No dedicated project managers.
* First-class developer tooling is a given
* Don't copy it, you would likely fail. _This is because the organizational structure of Big Tech greatly impacts how teams can – and do – execute._
