Ideas for 1<>1's, strengthen relationships\
"So I came up with the idea of discussing a topic, free choice but still work-related with the starting point being something that you recently came across and found interesting to share.**"**

* Frequency: Bi-weekly, alternating roles each session
* Duration: 30 minutes, no more
* Location: Office or remote. Both work well and I think it’s a good opportunity for remote sessions
* Preparation: The resource has to be sent at least a few days before in order to have time to think about it (we store the resource link and the questions on a Notion page)
* Any topic you find interesting
* Add a few related questions to discuss

<summary><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04302.pdf">How Developers and Managers Define and Trade Productivity for Quality</a></summary>

* Developers and managers defined productivity in terms of all five dimensions of SPACE, but only a few mentioned developer satisfaction and well-being. Notably, developers and managers, as cohorts, were not that closely aligned in their views of productivity as _developers are more likely to define productivity in terms of activity, while managers are more likely to define productivity in terms of performance._

<!---->

* Space stands for S (satisfaction with work and personal well-being), P (performance and quality of development outcomes), A (activity as the count of actions or outputs), C (collaboration and communication among people), E (efficiency and flow of work with minimal interruptions).
* Developer anticipation of how their managers define productivity is not aligned with how managers actually define productivity, as _managers are more likely to define productivity in terms of performance rather than activity. Developers also underestimated how often managers mentioned efficiency_ as an important aspect of productivity.
* Many _managers have accurate insights into how ICs define productivity_ (notably in terms of activity, performance and efficiency), even though those views are not well-aligned with their own definitions of productivity.
* Developers and managers defined quality, as co-horts, with the same inductively derived five themes (timeliness, robustness, delights users, meets collaboration needs, supports evolution). Over 70% of both cohorts mentioned robustness in their definitions of quality, while around a third mentioned "delights users" and is "evolvable".
* Over 50% of developers and mageners reported _trading quality for productivity_, most to meet _short-term needs. Technical debt_ and _insufficient testing_ were reported as trade-offs to achieve higher productivity with _timely feature delivery_ that _meets user needs_ and _unblock others. Legacy code, lack of time, poor return on investment and a culture_ that prioritizes faster feature delivery over quality were drivers for there trade-offs.
* Approximately one-third of developers and managers indicated they _do not trade quality for productivity,_ as they consider _quality an essential aspect of productivity (for new and legacy systems)._ However, _trading feature delivery for more quality can positivey or negatively impact developer satisfaction,_ depending on _team and manager priorities._
* SPACE and TRUCE, frameworks for software quality.
* TRUCE stands for The **timely** delivery of **robust** features that meets **user needs**, while enhancing **collaboration** with others and supporting the product's future **evolution**.

_Need_ is company needs

Startups always are constraint by time even more than money

_"The best leaders, the people do not know they have them, the lesser leaders are loved and praised, even lesser are feared and the least are despised. Those leaders who show no trust will not be trusted. Those leaders who are quiet, their words are valued. With the best leaders, when the people's task is completed, the people will say we did it ourselves." (_Lao Tzu - Tao Te Ching Chapter 17)

_"Hire the right people and let them do it themselves. Be a shepherd, not an emperor. Be an editor, not a tyrant. Do the hard things that are the right things and set your ego aside, because remember, no matter what, you will still get the credit."_
