Ideas for 1<>1's, strengthen relationships\
"So I came up with the idea of discussing a topic, free choice but still work-related with the starting point being something that you recently came across and found interesting to share.**"**

* Frequency: Bi-weekly, alternating roles each session
* Duration: 30 minutes, no more
* Location: Office or remote. Both work well and I think it’s a good opportunity for remote sessions
* Preparation: The resource has to be sent at least a few days before in order to have time to think about it (we store the resource link and the questions on a Notion page)
* Any topic you find interesting
* Add a few related questions to discuss
