# Welcome!

## Welcome aboard!

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online wiki built with Gitbook.

This is heavily inspired by [Maggie Appleton digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) and [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/)'s knowledge wiki.

### Why Gitbook?

I don't know, looks easy to use, I don't have to think about deployments or connections. Going to test it for a while but I have [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) on the radar too, maybe I will change it later.
