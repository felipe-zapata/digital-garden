# About me

Hi 👋

I'm Felipe, Technical leader making functions of Engineering Manager and Technical Architect with 9 years of experience in Software Development and 1 year in Technical leadership. Also hold a BS in Electronic Engineering from Universidad del Valle. Expertise in leading teams and designing scalable software that solves real-world challenges.

I have worked at a US-based scale-up where I built and led two engineering teams of 4 people each. I also architected and lead the development of several projects including new features, subsystems, and migrations.

I'm a technologist experienced in building frontends and backends in several technologies like React, NextJS, AWS, Node.js, and MySQL among others.

Here is how I can help you:&#x20;

* 🤼‍♀️ Manage teams. I can join you as an Engineering Manager. Setup OKRs and KPIs, do performance reviews, 1-1s, hiring, etc. I will lead a team and collaborate with others to ensure the right prioritization and team awareness.&#x20;
* 🤾🏽‍♀ Improve performance of engineering teams. I can help you scale and improve your engineering team’s performance by applying best practices from Agile and DevOps. Work on setting a culture of trust, mutual respect, and acceptance of failure. All proved to be the main drivers behind high-performing engineering teams.
* 👷‍♀️ Own technical architecture and write code. I’ll be happy to own the technical strategy together with the CTO and relief him/her from people management chores. I’m also comfortable owning the technical architecture myself and writing code. For example, I can take care of tedious things that are not top of mind for engineers (CI/CD, business dashboards, process design, etc.).
