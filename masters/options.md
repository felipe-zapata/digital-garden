* **Requirements:**
  * **A first-class or strong upper second-class undergraduate degree with honours** is normally required in a related subject, such as computer science, informatics or engineering. However, it is not essential where compensated by professional experience.&#x20;
  * Applications are invited from anyone with sufficient experience or proven ability in software, security, or data engineering. A typical applicant will have at least two years' experience in a professional environment, and normally holds an undergraduate degree in a related subject. However, more extensive experience may compensate for a lack of formal qualifications, and a strong, immediately-relevant qualification may compensate for a lack of professional experience.
