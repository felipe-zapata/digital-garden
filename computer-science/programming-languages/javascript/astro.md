# Astro

Framework for content-focused pages. For web applications, Next is a better choice.

MPA (multi-page application) framework.

First-page render is faster on MPAs, the following are faster on SPAs.

Astro island: interactive UI component on a static page. This architectural pattern builds on selective hydration. Just add "client:load" as a parameter on the call of the component.

Benefits of islands:\
\- Performance\
\- Parallel loading\
\- How and when to render each component with a client directive.
