# Designing Data Intensive Applications notes

## Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

**Reliability:** Tolerating hardware & software faults. Human error.\
**Scalability:** Measuring load & performance. Latency percentiles, throughput.\
**Maintainability:** Operability (making life easy for operations), simplicity (managing complexity) & evolvability (making change easy).

Response time: Is what the client sees, includes network delays, queueing delays and service time (actual time processing the request).\
Latency: Duration that a request is waiting to be handled.
