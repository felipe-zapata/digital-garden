# Python

## Basics

*   **How would you check if an object is an instance of a class?**

    _isInstance_() returns _True_ if the specified object is of the specified type, otherwise _False._
* **What is main the difference between lists and tuples In Python**
  * **Similarities:**
    * Both store multiple items under a single variable and ordered.
    * Both support unpacking
    * Can access items by their index in both
  * **Differences:**
    * Tuples are immutable whereas lists are mutable
*   **What is the difference between the is and == operators**

    _is_ will return _True_ if two variables point to the same object in memory, == if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.
* **Mention a few of the native Python data types**
  * tuple, list, range
  * str
  * int, float, complex
  * dict
  * set, frozenset
  * bool
  * bytes, bytearray, memoryview
  * NoneType
