### Outline and advice from Lee McKeeman

When coding, entry level folk can write the happy case, but you need to: \
• Account for edges \
• Be literate with data structures you choose, and advantages/disadvantages versus other options.\
• Decompose. \
One big method will be hard to adapt when you get a twist. It will show. Prep: Read code. Problems and solutions, real code, whatever you can that has quality checks. Do coding exercises, but focus on time from idea to code and a checklist to ensure you handle everything.

For system design: Preparing for this is likely going to be mock interviews and reading about scaling challenges on various tech blogs to see how real world problems have been solved.
