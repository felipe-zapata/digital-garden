**IPO:** Stands for Initial Public Offering, _refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance (_[_link_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)_)._

**Equity, however, is risky.** There is no guarantee of an IPO, and even less of the stock jumping as much as it did with Doordash or Airbnb.

**Vesting:** The terms of the negotiation, _refer to in what installments you'll "get" the equity._

_**Cliffs** are a clause that requires you to stay at a company for a minimum amount of time before you get any equity._

Depending on the negotiation and the company, you can be paid the same amount of money in units of stock each period (no risk but you are not going to get any upside either) or you can get the conversion when signing the contract (risk but upside if happens). On the latter, you are going to get the same amount of units of stock each period.

Equity refreshers and signing cash bonuses are tools for the company to give you more money.

**Clawbacks:** If you leave early, you have to pay back.

**Post termination exercise window:** If you leave, you have some time to exercise the stock that you have already vested. The standard is a 90-day exercise window. [Startups with extended exercise windows.](https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows)

**IPO lockup periods:** _Time frame when you cannot sell shares that you have vested, following an IPO. The standard term is 6 months._

**Red flags:** Predatory vesting or clawback terms, vesting more than 4 years, short windows to exercise options, stock granted as dollars in a high-growth pre-IPO company (yellow flag).

**Main question:** _How much is my options package worth, assuming the company goes public/is acquired at $X valuation._

_**Options are only worth anything if there will be a financial event - IPO or acquisition - where the shares will become liquid.**_

**RSUs:** Restricted Stock Units - are a form of stock compensation that publicly traded companies often offer to software engineers. Basically stock from a publicly traded company.

**Double-trigger RSUs:** Concept for pre-IPO companies (non-public (yet)). Similar to RSUs. You need to pay a tax on capital gains for stock that you've vested. Stock does not vest until a second trigger and taxes are due after that trigger (and not before).

**ESPP:** (Employee stock purchase plans) A public company let you buy stock with a discount. Those programs have a contribution limit, a maximum amount of money in stocks to purchase.

**Phantom shares:** RSUs but without real stock, they pay the profits after vesting. There is a plan called _Appreciation only_, the company only pays the difference in price between the "issued" stock price vs the vested one.

**SARs:** Stock appreciation rights - middle-ground between stock options and RSUs. Employees would gain the increase in the stock price of the company during a predefined period. Good, no upfront costs. Bad, little flexibility when to exercise after vesting, and no ownership of the company after leaving.

**Virtual shares, Virtual options:** Same as Phantom Shares.

**Growth shares:** Stock options with "ifs".

**Dilution:** It's the _inflation_ of stock value. Freshly issued stock appears so old stock loses value.

**Full Ratchet:** Anti-dilution clauses. Included to protect early investors.
