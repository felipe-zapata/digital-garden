* [ ] Review tree avoidance and landings.
* [ ] Review building avoidance and landings.
* [ ] Review water avoidance and landings.
* [ ] Review aircraft emergency procedures.

#### CANOPY SKILLS

* [x] Plan and fly a landing approach pattern that promotes smooth traffic flow and avoids obstacles.
* [x] Demonstrate a stand-up landing
* [x] Land within 65 feet of a preselected target on at least five jumps.
* [x] Perform rear-riser turns (brakes set and released).
* [ ] Accurately predict the presence and effects of turbulence in the landing area.

#### EQUIPMENT KNOWLEDGE

* [ ] Demonstrate knowledge, inspection, donning, use, and owner maintenance of all equipment to be used on the jump.
* [ ] Calculate the wing loading of both main and reserve canopies and compare the sizes against the manufacturerâ€™s published recommendations.
* [ ] Demonstrate the understanding, use, and disconnection of a reserve static line.
* [ ] Demonstrate the understanding and use of an automatic activation device.
* [ ] Check equipment for another skydiver.
* [ ] Perform manufacturer-recommended owner service on a canopy release system.
* [ ] Change or adjust a main closing loop.
* [ ] Show knowledge of FAA rules on parachute packing intervals and required personnel.

#### AIRCRAFT & SPOTTING

* [ ] Demonstrate understanding of seat belt use and applicable FARs
* [ ] Identify local runway headings, lengths, and aircraft approach and departure patterns.
* [ ] Using an aviation winds aloft forecast, select the correct exit and opening point.
* [ ] Recite cloud clearance and visibility requirements for above and below 10,000 feet MSL.
* [ ] Receive a briefing on weight and balance, the effect of a jumper on aircraft control surfaces when outside an aircraft, spotting, and radio and onboard communication procedures
* [ ] In routine jump conditions, plan with a jump pilot and spot the aircraft without assistance.

#### VERIFICATION

* [ ] 25 skydives
* [ ] A-license oral exam
*   [ ] A-license written exam

    2. equipment operation and maintenance
       1. wing loading and its effects
       2. closing loop
       3. velcro and tuck flaps
       4. packing and authorization to pack
    3. canopy flight
       1. traffic patterns and collision avoidance
       2. braked turns and obstacle avoidance
       3. low turn avoidance and recovery
       4. downwind landing procedures
       5. obstacle landing emergency and recovery procedures
    4. aircraft procedures
       1. during jump run and exit to observe balance limits
       2. distance between groups to maintain separation
       3. aircraft emergency procedures
    5. group breakoff recommendations
    6. parachute emergency procedures
       1. deployment malfunctions
       2. cutaway decide-and-act altitude
       3. two-canopies-deployed scenarios
    7. accountability for FAR compliance

### Jump planification

I'm currently on my jump number 17th

* [ ] Hop and pop
  * Stable exit
  * Landing with downwind
    * [ ] Pack a main parachute without assistance.
    * [ ] Jump and deploy while stable within five seconds after exit from 3,500 feet AGL.
* [ ] Check dive
  * [ ] Demonstrate freefall control on all axes, with a backloop, front loop, and barrel roll
  * [ ] Dive a minimum of 100 feet after another jumper and dock safely without assistance from the other jumper (two times).
  * [ ] Locate and open clear of other jumpers and wave off to signal deployment
  * [ ] Plan and independently execute a break-off from a group skydive with a minimum 100 feet of horizontal sep- aration from another jumper or group. Separation must be gained independently in a straight track within ten degrees of a radial heading from the center of the formation.
  *   [ ] Check dive with USPA Instructor (See SIM 3-2.A.1.c)

      The examining USPA Instructor conducts a skydive with the applicant to verify practical knowledge in the following areas:

      1. choosing the spot and selecting and guiding the pilot to the correct exit and opening point in routine conditions
      2. pre-jump equipment checks for self and others
      3. planning an effective group break-off
      4. right 360, left 360, and a backloop (backloop to be completed within 60 degrees of the original heading)
      5. docking from 20 feet (evaluator flies into position)
      6. breakoff altitude recognition and tracking for a minimum of 100 feet
      7. signal before deployment and overall awareness during and after deployment
      8. planning and flying a logical landing pattern that promotes a smooth traffic flow and avoids other jumpers
      9. packing and preparing equipment for the next jump
* [ ] Another jump
  * [ ] Perform a braked approach and landing.
  * [ ] Above 1,000 feet, perform front riser dives and turns (may be waived if insufficient strength).
* [ ] Another
  * [ ] Above 2,500 feet, perform a maximum-performance 90-degree toggle turn, followed immediately by a turn of at least 180 degrees in the opposite direction (two times).
